# Hello, World! 👋🏼

### About me
I started programming out of curiosity about game development. Over time, I became even more interested in programming and began to search more about it. I became somewhat familiar with C# through my studies with Unity, then with creating some Minecraft plugins with Java, and finally Python for developing small console projects.

Today, I focus on learning web development for professional purposes, while doing some experiments with Godot to learn more about game development.
